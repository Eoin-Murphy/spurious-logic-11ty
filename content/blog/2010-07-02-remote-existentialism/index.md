So I've been working from home the last few days. That slightly sore shoulder from the ergonomic keyboard turned into full on muscle spasm which means I can't really drive/need to take regular lie downs while working. No the irony is not lost on me. Especially as it's the best waves in the last 3 months hitting the beaches right now and I can't even go boogie boarding. My powerless rage knows no bounds.

But anyway, I'm working from home and I feel more stressed than usual. There's no reason. I'm working, work is being done and I'm not missing anything in the office. Sure there's some slight miscommuinications using only text/bad phone lines but nothing serious.

A lot of the work I do doesn't have any immediate deliverables. This means that when I'm working from home I imagine it looks like I'm not doing anything productive. But I AM!!! I find my self holding back from sending crazy frequent status updates to everyone just to let them know I'm active. I imagine team peers looking at my empty desk and tut tutting. So I work harder and get frustrated with problems which would be trivial in the office (the slight lag here doesn't help either).

Time to relax and realise that yes, I am a useful and productive member of the team and that they all know this...

Angst of the (home) office employee...
