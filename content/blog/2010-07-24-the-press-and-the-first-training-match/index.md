![meetThePress001](/assets/img/meetThePress001.png "meetThePress001")I don't trust my interpreter. Maybe it was the way he looked at me when we first met. Derision for a foreign manager, an outsider. "Spaniards are the worlds best footballers _and_ we have the best managers" he seemed to be thinking. Maybe it was the limp fish handshake, all soft palm and slightly cold, clammy skin. It could be he's just nervous about dealing with the press. Or, it could have been the look of absolute confusion crossed his face when I said "Hello". It was a full minute of furrowed brow concentration when he replied ["Jess, Hechlo"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma8Vwkpx5y8).

But he's all I've got as I must negotiate the potential minefield that is my first press conference. Afterwards  I'll be getting a first look at the players in action against the u19 squad.

I will be witty, charming and funny but still serious and determined. Positive and hopeful while at the same time showing restraint and not putting too much pressure on the team for the year ahead. In short a borderline schizophrenic compulsive liar. ![press0001](/assets/img/press0001.png "press0001")

... I've always wanted to manage an almost bankrupt 3rd division semi-professional team ...

![press0002](/assets/img/press0002.png "press0002")

...not mentioning that this defense is so porous that it could be used as pumice stone...

![press0003](/assets/img/press0003.png "press0003")

...because the current staff is so incompetent I don't trust them to organise a pissup in a brewery...

... for the slow people down the back; most of you are not worthy but we can't afford do drop anyone...

So on out to the first team vs the u19's friendly match. I genuinely don't know who's better, so we'll soon see.

Mini Report: **Ruben** with a nice turn and shot to score, (he actually turns his man all through the game) after a pass from **Asier Gazapo**. Lots of shots from outside the area. Half-time; all change. **Calderon** looks good before **Otero** heads in a great cross but it's offside. **Otero** then sets up **Fernández** and he can't miss from the 6 yard box with a header.

Well, if all we have to face all season is U19 squads, we'll be fine. I'm thinking I need to tie **Otero** down with a contract as he looks a bit good (especially for a 16 year old) and **Calderon** looks like he might be the man to lead the line with **Ruben** as a supporting striker. The goalie and defence looked fine but given the lack of attacking from the U19's I couldn't really tell. As for the midfield, they didn't dominate against a bunch of under par 16-17 year old players so I think I need to shore up there. A good solid defensive midfielder and maybe an creative attacker.

Formation wise, I'm going to go for an attacking 4-4-2. The either the right or left fullback set to attacking with the center backs and opposite fullback on defensive duty. Two defensive midfielders holding the centre and two wingers set to attack. Finally two forwards, one little one large. No it's not original, no it's not innovative and if we come up against a better team we'll get beat. But this is how the players are used to playing so it's best to stick with it for now. Passing will be short, pressing will be high, and defensive line will push up.

**Ancor(GK)** **Daniel Leon** (RB) **- **Marquinhos** (CB) **- **Florea Iacob** (CB) - **Pablo** (LB)**\******* **Adrián Martínez (AMR)** - **Juan Jésus** (MC)\* **- **Asier Gasparo** (DMC)\* **-**** **Carolos Caballero** **(AML)**

****Rubén** (Deep lying forward) **- **Antonio Calderon****** (Target man)

\*until replaced.

I know I'm probably going to get spanked but I think it's best to start with what you know and work from there.

Now with 23 triallists coming in, surely some one of them will be a decent central midfielder.

\-- No I will not be keeping up this level of commentry, but at the start it's as easy to keep the notes here. --
