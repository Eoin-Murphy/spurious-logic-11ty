So last week was spent in [giove](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&q=Giove+Terni,+Umbria,+Italy&sll=51.899164,-8.471146&sspn=0.12054,0.239639&ie=UTF8&cd=1&geocode=FeuniAId3Sq8AA&split=0&z=13&iwloc=A) in Italy which was absolutely fantastic. It's a nice little village with a really, really good restaurant/wine bar (Donkishot). I'll stick up photos when I get a chance.

During the break I've had a chance to think about my career and where I'm headed (introspection in the italian countryside....) and I'm going to aim to get some certifications under my belt. I'm going to aim for MSPD and the zend PHP certification.

Also I need to work on a design portfolio so I'm going to (finally) get around to redesigning this site and I'll blog the process as I go. I'd like to do some custom coding allowing demonstration of different design on different posts. Actually, there's probably a plugin out there that does this already.
