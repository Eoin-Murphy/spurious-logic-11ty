You want to know what’ll wake you up better than a cup of coffee? Have a cup of coffee early in the day, followed shortly by an apple. Put the apple core in the empty coffee mug, to be dumped in the rubbish later (either because you have no bin or because the bin won’t be emptied for three days and you don’t want to have to sit next to a rotting apple for that long).

Now wait for three to four hours and forget about the apple core.

Make yourself another pot of coffee and pour that black steaming brew into the reused mug. Close your eyes and savour the aroma as you bring the mug to your lips. Feel the hot coffee and slightly cold slimy apple core against your top lip.

That’ll wake you up..

Also, I got some sweets from Amsterdam. They seem to be finely calibrated to be very tasty while eating them initially. But a weird aftertaste means that you don’t want to eat too many of them Crafty Dutches…
