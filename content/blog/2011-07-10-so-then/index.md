[![](/assets/img/IMG_0722-300x225.jpg "IMG_0722")](http://spurious-logic.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0722.jpg) Between buying a house which needs extensive refurbishments, changing jobs and an eight month old I haven't had time to blog.

May be a while before I'm doing this regularly again as there's still an amount of work to be done with the house and while I'm confident at the new job there's always a sharp learning curve when you're getting started anywhere.

Some house pictures after the jump.
