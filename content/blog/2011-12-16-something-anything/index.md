It's good to post. Or to write. Something, anything. Just to remind yourself that the little "Publish" button still works.

It would be an understatement to say it's been a busy few months but I'll spare you the deeply personal but yet stultifyingly dull details of everything which has gone on.

Instead, I'm going to show you part of my commute...![](images/IMG_1149-1024x768.jpg "IMG_1149")

it beats queuing in traffic for a roundabout. 15 mins seaside drive to a picturesque town. Then 10 mins back road spin to a business park.

Suck it townines!
