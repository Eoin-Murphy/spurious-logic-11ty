I love my split keyboards because they allow me to change my workspace to fit me. And this week my tendonitis flared up again. So, I was able to set them at a 80% tenting angle and now? No more elbow pain. That and just less typing helps.

And! it seems like the bluetooth connection problem I have been having is fixed by adding this the config:

CONFIG_ZMK_BLE=y
CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONN=y

[More info here](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1487)


Here's hoping that this time it keeps working ,
