So I've been on eMusic for years at this stage and I'm always happy with the stuff they have on there. Not to say I've made some bad downloads but it is a fantastic service towards finding new music.

Jamendo on the other hand is something I signed up to ages ago, took a look around and didn't bother with after that. Jamendo is a pretty site but doesn't have the hand holding editorial features and the music is of a much wider genre variety and genre standard.

eMusic all sounds professionally produced, signed (if independent) bands wheras Jamendo tracks often sound self recorded.

I then found: [http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/64104](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/64104) (good pop music. Not entirely my cup of tea but I can recognise quality - better than most chart pop anyway)

and [http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/49216](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/49216) - REALLY not my thing but I can't think of any other site where you'd find the description "METAL Â SWING" and it'd be accurate.

<edit> After about 2 hours browsing Jamendo, I remember why I havn't been there in a while. The ratio of experimental noodling/crap metal/shitty electro trance dance to actual good stuff is so high it's not much fun. I realise it's good to have somewhere that anyone can put music up but some sort of ranking/accurate tags/editorial control would be nice. I don't want to say quality control because well, quality in this context is entirely subjective and I wouldn't want to see anyone not get up there because an admin doesn't like that style.
