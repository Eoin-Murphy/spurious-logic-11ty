Well the only quickfix would be to use a decent, dedicated email program.

My specific problem with lotus notes (the most irritating one after the non-escapeable splash screen but before the no indication observance of the scroll lock key) is this constant popup during the program start up letting me know "You missed some reminders" or something to that effect.

Some of these are 9 months old. I've searched the knowledge base at IBM which talked about corrupted email files, I've clicked on every damn option there is, accept, hold, delete. All to no avail.

There's two lotus notes programmes. The full blown Lotus Notes which sits glowering on your task bar like a jaundiced yellow eye. And then there's it's little brother Lotus Notes Minder, which hides away in the system tray just checking for new mail.

So, needing the desktop real estate I fired up the tidier of the two and was presented with a series of popups which let me 'Ok' all of the missed tasks.

And they're gone! Almost a full year of being irritated by these pointless, out of date notifications, gone.

Thanks Lotus Notes, for providing such a useful and well documented feature!

p.s. Lotus Notes isn't actually all that bad if you want the full gamut of email, calendar management, task sharing, file sharing etc all under one program. But if all you want is an email program then it's a pain
