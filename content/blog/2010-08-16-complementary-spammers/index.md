![](images/cauliflower.jpg "cauliflower")So here's a short selection of the comments spam I've received over the last year or so:

If you are wondering how you can help with this or future events, please contact us . Also, you can contact other

I would like to exchange links with your site spurious-logic.net Is this possible?

Many thanks!

it was very interesting to read spurious-logic.net I want to quote your post in my blog. It can? And you et an account on Twitter?

Thank you for the sensible critique. Me & my neighbour were preparing to do some research about that. We got a good book on that matter from our local library and most books where not as influensive as your information.

Took me time to read all the comments, but I really enjoyed the article. It proved to be Very helpful to me and I am sure to all the commenters here! It’s always nice when you can not only be informed, but also entertained!

Great Blog! I have a similar site, and get a lot of spam. Do you face such problems? Can you please recommend some steps I take to combat spam. Thanks.

Very useful informations about these subject. I have found them with googling and you seems number one of these subjects ! . . .

Hi I found your site by mistake when i was searching yahoo for this acne issue, I must say your site is really helpful I also love the design, its amazing!. I don’t have the time at the moment to fully read your site but I have bookmarked it and also add your RSS feeds. I will be back in a day or two. thanks for a great site.

Now, as much as I love being the number one site on Google for acne issues I am not sure that such effusive praise from vintage\_in\_usa or "online pharmacy without perscription" earned. I mean in the post about Microsoft SQL Server I barely touched on weight loss medicine which is why people come to this site.

I obviously need to pander to the wider audience of herbal remedy seekers out there rather than bored IT workers if I'm ever going to expand my audience.

Yes I realise the irony that I'm going to probably be flagged as a spam site and also attract more spam comments as a result of this post. I wonder if they'll ever come up with a spam bot good enough to get even basic semantic meaning from an article, post multiple, conversational/counter-argument posts to fool the admin. I imagine that the worlds first strong AI will be trying to sell cheap toner cartridges.
