no, really.

I think that for your average developer/office worker the 15 mins break outside every 2 hours or so is very healthy. A pity about sucking the addictive poison into your lungs aspect to it but hey, you can't have everything.

So my challenge is to find a socially acceptable habit to allow you to just stand around outside on a regular basis which isn't expensive and bad for your health.
