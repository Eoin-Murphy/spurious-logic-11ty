almost  two full months with no posts.

And so the death knell of the blog sounds... a single lonely cracked peal across a mist shrouded field...

Or something. Anyway that's what you get with a busy social Christmas and hectic work new year.

Christmas was good. Surfing over the new year and every weekend since.

Off on holidays until March and if I can I'll throw up some pics.

Until then, slán abhaile.
