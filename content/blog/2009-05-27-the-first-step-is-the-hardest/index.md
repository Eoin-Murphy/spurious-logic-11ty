I would like to dedicate this post to the registrars of spurious-logic.com. Domain squatters which I doubt will ever, ever do anything with that site. It was unclaimed when I first checked it and is now taken (Is there tracking on the whois queries from certain providers?).

No big deal as the .net suits me fine but it's just another sign that the internet is turning into aÂ  street with empty lots plastered with for sale signs and advertising for XXX shows down the road.

<edit> Having seen this post in the theme, it's far too busy for my liking and I'm gonna have to change it. That's what you get when you just use the vanilla themes from wordpress. Good starting points, rough around the edges.
