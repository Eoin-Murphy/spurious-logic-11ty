...somewhere under a goverment research facility...

I've just cleared out a bandit nest and I have to crawl into an old water tank by way of a disused pipe. About half way up I begin hearing the breathing.

Not a person or even an animal.

the tunnels are breathing.

Long drawn out gasps of wind through the tunnels. At the peak of the inhalation there's a pause and my vision is distorted and grainy for a second or so. Then with exhalation the world skews sideways.

Fighting down panic and disorientation I stand calmly and wait if this is just the precursor for anything else. It is not. Ransacking the nest I find the usb stick I'm looking for and move on. All the while with the breathing.

As I move towards my exit point, the breathing continues, inconsistent and nerve grating. A long tunnel with two ladders up. As I climb the first I'm propelled upwards by some force and slammed against the cover. Again disoriented I drop to the ground and retreat. "Was it an anomoly?" I wonder as applying bandages and med packs. I decide to try the other ladder.

As I pass the ladder, I am again fired against the roof but I keep moving. Then I'm dragged forward, forced back and bounced off every wall. am shocked I . shocked am I. I am shocked. Dragged forward again, with no control I see the creature toying with me and begin firing wildly.

<edit>

I found a [youtube clip someone made of this encounter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU9IS3eS3_w&feature=related). It doesn't totally get the sense of panic but you'll get the idea.
