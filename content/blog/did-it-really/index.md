Error 1 The command "D:\\Projects\\Applications.Core\\PostBuildScripts\\ProjectPostBuild.bat Web.IniTechWeb D:\\Projects\\Website\\QA\\Project\\IniTech\\Web\\IniTechWeb\\" exited with code 1. IniTech.Web.IniTechWeb

Fuck me, just what I need. Some piece of the build script, which noone has touched in about 6 months failing. I have better things to look at...

<edit> And of course, restarting my PC now means that it's working.
