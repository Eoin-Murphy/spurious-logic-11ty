If you're providing software to a goverment to enable citizens to do tax returns online, your company should probably be called something more professional than "Legion of the Bouncy Castle".

Good god, what were they thinking.

Looking at their site they seem to be a good open source crypto shop. but still, I can see people not installing the software when they spot the name.
