So the owners of Spurious-Logic.com finally got in contact with me and made me the most generous of offers:

![spurious-sales](images/spurious-sales.jpg "spurious-sales")There's something about cyber-squatting that just gets up my nose...

Oh yeah, it's the idea that you can make a profit for no work (beyond the minimal inital investment).

The fact that it results in url sprawl and incorrect used of tld's. You end up with something like www.acmeCorporationWebsite.com instead of www.Acme.com because it's being squatted.

Then again this is all somewhat a nerdy moot point since no-one uses URL's to find sites anymore. It's straight to google to find that site. Of course that's so much better
