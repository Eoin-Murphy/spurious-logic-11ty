So [as I said](http://spurious-logic.net/?p=273), I bought the THQ package from Steam and downloaded Red Faction.

No not "Red Faction Guerilla", or even "Red Faction 2", the first one.I've heard all sorts of good things about "Red Faction Guerilla" and I wanted to give it a go but never really felt like paying the amount they were asking (it was the inclusion of Saints Row 2 and the Dawn of War games which swung me on the package for only â‚¬50)

I wanted to play the whole Red Faction oeuvre through to get a sense of the game and playing the first one really does feel like I'm playing a 10 year old console game. Linear progression, fiddly controls and blocky graphics. So far I'm still trundling through the underground caverns shooting my 12mm at sprite like models of security guards.

The weirdest thing for me is that I actually had this game on PS2. I covered about the same distance in 20 minutes on the PC yesterday as took me 2~3 hours with a console controller. I have a distinct memory of the game being challenging and tense whereas with the mouse it's just fiddly and fairly straightforward. Still fairly fun though.

And the brown, the brown every where.
