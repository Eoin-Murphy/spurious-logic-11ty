**Parkinson's First Law:** Work expands or contracts in order to fill the time available.

**Parkinson's Second Law:** Expenditures rise to meet income.

**Parkinson's Third Law:** Expansion means complexity; and complexity decay.

**Parkinson's Fourth Law:** The number of people in any working group tends to increase regardless of the amount of work to be done.

**Parkinson's Fifth Law:** If there is a way to delay an important decision the good bureaucracy, public or private, will find it.

**Parkinson's Law of Delay:** Delay is the deadliest form of denial.

**Parkinson's Law of Triviality:** The time spent in a meeting on an item is inversely proportional to its value (up to a limit).

**Parkinson's Law of 1,000:** An enterprise employing more than 1,000 people becomes a self-perpetuating empire, creating so much internal work that it no longer needs any contact with the outside world.

**Parkinson's Coefficient of Inefficiency:** The size of a committee or other decision-making body grows at which it becomes completely inefficient.
