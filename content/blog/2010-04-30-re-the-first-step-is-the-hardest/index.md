So, just under one year since starting this blog. 46 (inconsistent) posts so far and I've finally made my own (very simple) theme. I call it ... the theme... As you can tell I'm a big fan of easily readable websites. but as you can tell there's a whole load of stuff missing from this theme that would be de reigeur for any real theme.

So I suggest you look at the actual word press site for a proper starting point.

Apart from that, one year still posting!! wee!! (still no comments though)
