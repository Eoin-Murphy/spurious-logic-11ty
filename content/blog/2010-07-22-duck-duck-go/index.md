![duckduckgo](/assets/img/duckduckgo.png "duckduckgo")So apart from the silly name [duckduckgo.com](http://duckduckgo.com/) is quite a nice little search engine that I've been using over the last few months. Apart from some very obscure stuff it's been as good as Google (and where it can't find anything it has a nice "Try Google" link).

The interface is nice; no separate pages, the results just load as you scroll down. Minimal ads, personalisable settings and a privacy guarantee on searches/results.

Using it today I found my way onto searchdotnet.com which is a dedicated .Net developer search engine. Seems to work so far.
