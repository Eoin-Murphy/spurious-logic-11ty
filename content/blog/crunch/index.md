...crunch.

So, we had twocrunch releases in a row. It wasn't quite 80 hour weeks but still stressful.

No so much fun and lots of work crammed in a short space of time means there's inevitably issues which are going to rear their heads down the line and demand extensive refactoring.

But we got new features working in record time for a demanding client who were jumping up and down for them with a solid architecture which should be maintainable.

Points of note:

1) Identify and complete blocking tasks first. I know this sounds obvious but if there's new work which can't be  done because of blocking task- then you're wasting time.

2) Get prototypes in front of the decision makers as quickly as you can. This is linked to the above.

3) Get real data (or at the very least realistic testing data) on a quickly as you can. Get your testing team and decision makers seeing what the end product will actually be working with.

Typically, there's a lull of a few days after a release goes out, but when the leftovers of the previous release have to be taken care of as part of the current release, you need to be in high gear from the get go or you're going to be suffering at the end of the release cycle.

I know, I know, this is all project management 101 but when you're in the middle of something it's easy to miss what the real priority is.

The start of this release is tidying up the last release. So I'd better get back to work.

 

p.s. Not blogging much because (a) I'm very busy at work (b) There's nothing bitesized to blog about and a lot of the work is financial world oriented (c) I'm very busy at home.
