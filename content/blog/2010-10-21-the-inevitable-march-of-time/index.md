So I was looking over some old sites I used to run. Thank you archive.org for keeping a record of sites which should have disappeared into the ether. Being a C.S. student means that I've had a webpage on and off since 1998 or so and the quality has, how will I say, _varied_ during that time. There's a couple of pieces which are fantastic, some which are nonsensical but most just make me cringe.

I guess that's totally natural. What I did in my youth (I'm only 30 but it seems like a million years ago- it was only 6) seems like it was almost a different person. I did things then that I wouldn't be able to do now, because I know better. And there's things I can do now which I wouldn't have been able to do then. I'm not going to beat myself up over embarrassing photos or posts which I made 6-10 years ago because it made sense at the time. I am however glad that I lived in a pre-facebook age when my online identity isn't forever associated with me.

I also found that I used to post content up in much shorter form (usually due to having to update via telnet/ssh over a slow connection) and much less frequently. I don't think that it was a lack of free time, but rather, when I had free time I was out _socializing_ wheras now I've got a lot less free time but lots of internet access and (arguably) less to say.
