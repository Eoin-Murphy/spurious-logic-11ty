I imagine I'm not the only person who got vaguely excited that today is a purely binary date 11.01.11 (or 01.11.11 if you use a broken datetime format) or 55 in decimal. It was very satisfying to spend an idle moment converting from binary 110111 to decimal 55 (or 011111 to 31). Just reminds me of all the low level stuff I learned back in college which I will almost never use (and if I am actually using as part of my job, then something has gone very, very wrong - hardware engineers excepted).
