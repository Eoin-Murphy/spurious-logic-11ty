 [![imgres](/assets/img/imgres.jpg)](http://spurious-logic.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/imgres.jpg)So, I haven't written in months. This is what happens when you start a new job and have to diveÂ in head first to get going with it.

So, while I'm still stupid busy, I want to at least start getting back to regular writing. I have some good seed ideas from over the last few month (mostly to do with developer/manager splits, agile development hiccups and new introducing new technology and practices into a legacy bound company) but they're all pretty substantial pieces and I don't have the time to work them up to a presentable state.

So, there may be a bunch of small, trite posts to tide me over until more time is available to me.
