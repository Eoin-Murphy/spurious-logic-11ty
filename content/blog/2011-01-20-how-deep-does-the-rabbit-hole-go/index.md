[![](images/Alice_par_John_Tenniel_02.png)](http://spurious-logic.net/how-deep-does-the-rabbit-hole-go)I find myself slipping more and more into extreme geekery.

This week I've:

1. started obsessing about getting myself a new mechanical pencil. Currently the front runners are a [straight replacement of what I currently have](http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?V=1&Sec=13&Sub=54&PID=2553) or [this](http://www.cultpens.com/acatalog/Platinum-Pro-Use-MSD-1000.html#a15421). I'm thinking that the MUJI pencil is more practical, cheaper and I prefer it's clean design. I've had my current one for around 2 years at the moment and it's been perfect for notes and sketches
2. got really excited about a project here at work dealing with translating arbitrary input strings out into four distinct columns using a set of user defined rules. Taking a project from requirements all the way through design, feedback to implementation, testing and deployment is something I haven't done in a while and it makes a very nice break from maintenance work.
3. performed binary to digital conversion in my head for fun...
