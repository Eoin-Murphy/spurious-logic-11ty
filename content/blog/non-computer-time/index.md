So no update for the last few weeks.

As the post suggest I've been busy outside of work with non computer stuff (namely renovating a garage and moving house) while at work I've been pretty busy.

Also I've realised an issue with this blog. I've done my best to keep it focussed on technology and software development but honestly, while I have a lot of opinions and thoughts on this, they're not the easiest things to write about, without talking more specifically about the kind of work that I do.

So, I'm going to start writing more about other interests and that should bump my post count right back up again...

so a meta post about posting. they suck and it's not a good sign this early on ....
