_I'm not sure what it was at new years. I took a drink of what the locals called "Devils firejuice" (warning: do not place in contact with metal due to risk of explosion) and the second half of the season is a total blank. I have my notes on each match such as they are so I'll do my best to scrape some sense into them..._

Ok, so I played the games and took the following notes as I was playing. That was two to three months ago and I haven't had the time to even turn on the computer since then. Frankly the idea of having to find a common thread to all of these is a little intimidating and I'm not inclined to spend time on it as I have other priorities. So I'm going to pull these into semi coherent form and put them up as is. So I'll start with a clean slate in preseason. (which is where I left the game) - probably in about a months' time..

 

Match Reports

 

### home to dover: fa trophy first round replay

We set out to attack and concede in under two minutes after poor kickout. I swapped out Brown for Henderson on 23 mins (the tipping point was when Brown was dispossessed and then fell over in midfield which leading to a shot on goal for the opposition). Following this change we started dominating possesion with a number of good chances. Eventually, after 43 mins, after knocking on the door for ages, Wright is on the spot at the far post to collect a deep free kick from Bowden. I tell the team to keep on attacking.

On seventy three minutes karl jones chips a ball into the box for Yates to chase down. He catches it just at the byline and with no Blyth players in the box he hits it off a dover defender to force an own goal. As Dover then go to all out attack, they start leaving room at the back. Grieve picks up a loose ball in midfield and puts Henderson through on goal where he finishes neatly into the far corner.

On 78 minutes, their winger, Waller gets the ball on the wide left and while he'll say it was a shot, it looked like a shanked cross, over Earl and just under the crossbar. So we persist with stalling tactics for 15 mins and run out winners.

### Game 22: Stalybridge (20th)

I picked some youth teamers to replace tired FA Trophy 'heroes'. There was no action really during the first half. I brought the proper first team players on at half time and set them up to attack They still weren't breaking through so on 75 mins I sent on Grieve (bravely telling him "You can make the difference"). And he did. Coming short for the ball from the defenders, carrying where necessary and pinging passes around. In injury time Bowden is brought down in the area for a penalty and we scrape a win.

### Game 23: Workington

2nd vs 3rd. We concede on 2 mins. Equalise on 2:50.With Wright crossing to Yates. We concede again from scramble in the box after a corner on 9 minutes. I threw on 3 subs on half time but it takes until 88 mins to equalise when Dunlop crosses for Yates to score again.

Lesson learned? don't send out an experimental side against the teams immediately above you. Those are the important games. Still a draw is an ok result away. It's picking up the spares that wins the league.

### Game 24: Farsley

Bottom club. no action. Yates missing some sitters. Off for Henderson who falls over in the box on 72 mins, penalty. Potter misses it. on 79 mins, Henderson receives a throw in from the left hand side and cut inside. He passes to McManus, in space 10 yards outside the box. McManus then launches one into the top right corner from 25 yards. Of course we concede from the kickoff. A right wing cross into the box, nodded home. Bad left back.... shit... offside... hold on to win 1-0

### Game 25: Workington

Again 2nd vs 3rd. Counter, narrow direct. specific, opposition tailored instructions for each player... 5 minutes in and Glenn Richardson cleans out one of their players in the box to concede a penalty. 0-1 down. They keep attacking though and grieve sets up Henderson for an easy finish on 9 mins. 

On 57 minutes, a frantic, scrambled attack results in a great goal. Grieves intercepts and passes to Yates. The ball is too long and wide but Yates gets it under control wide left of the goal on the byline. With 3 defenders around him he turns back downfield and passes to Bowden. Bowden hangs a great cross into the box where Henderson is top of a queue of Blyth players to nod it home. They have a player sent off for a second yellow for pulling down yates shocking equaliser from 20 yuards break from goal. injury time.

### Game 26: Corby

New loan signing from Newcastle. [Luke Lord](http://spurious-logic.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/luke_lord001.jpg). Goes straight in up front. different fullbacks & dunlop at centreback. 2 goals conceded from corners before half time. All change. 64 mins - another bundled in from a corner. Hattrick for Logan. 75 mins, another conceded... angry. picked wrong team, then chasing. 

Stevie Millar has been gone for over a month on international duty at this stage.

### F.A. Trophy Second Round: Eastbourne Borough

lots of pressure. narrow, deep counter. Weather early storm and coming up to half time we have our own few chances. Hoyle injured 2nd half. hit our bar twice. Replay in the offing.

### F.A. Trophy Second Round Repaly

Eastbourne Borough replay. At home -> go out with usual attacking approach. Grieve really does make a difference in midfield. Concede from corner on 36 mins. All out attack. Grieves to Yates to equalize from kickoff. On 56 mins, lord with a header from dunlops cross. 60 mins counter & subs. have to attack as I can't defend. win 2-1.

### Game 27: Vauxhall

Richardson nods in a cross from Dunlop on just 2 minutes. Exploit the flanks. Lord playing well. Again Grieve, to Yates in space in the box. Smashed into the far corner. "He loves to give it full gun". 62 mins... slow counter & subs. They score from a break down the left and header in. Tired legs at fullback. nervy but we hold on.

### Game 28: Fleetwood

Send them out with usual, attacking short. With the rain, change to more direct. No real chances. On 22 mins, Earls to Dunlop. Dunlop, Jones & Wright pass it between themselves up the flank until Wright passes to Henderson who rolls the ball across the box to Lord for a relatively easy tap in. Concede the equaliser 3 mins later. Direct from a 35 yard freekick. ah well. 4-1-3-2 bowden off... 57 mins. cross from left back, striker gets over richardson... 2-1 down. 60 mins, wright crosses from very deep... yates nods it in. 67 mins... penalty to us. Henderson converts We win 3-2

### Game 29: Gainsborough

4 injuries. Jason Bull at cb. On 9 mins yates bursts into the area to pick up a grieve through ball and hamemrs it home. Offside. Bowden hits bar from freekick.

fucking hell, Yates fires in a 30 yarder from nothing. great goal. They have a player sent off on 70 mins. 81 mins, Jason Bull scores a goal from a corner. Takes it short, jinks past 2 defenders and finishes cooly.

### F.A. Trophy: Lewes

@ the dripping pan (yes this was actually the name of the stadium) I tell the team to be more direct and aim to score on the counter. Plenty of chances for us. Turner playing well, drops back and into midfield regularly. Grieve to henderson to Yates for a nice counter goal on 43 mins. Lost of scares... They equalize on a through ball on 73 mins. overload etc... On the break, turner runs, is through on goal but cuts back into the crowd of defenders. and puts Mcmanus in on goal.. 2-1 to us 83 mins. we win

### Game 30: Southport

Left winger Lawson into first squad as a replacement for the ever travelling Millar. 5 mins, Karl Jones exactly bisects the two centre backs, Henderson shrugs them off and slots home past the keeper from 6 yards. They level 3 mins later after their winger gets behind dunlop to finish at the near post from a through ball. Henderson off, mcmanus on. Yates runs from inside our half to put Jones throught. Shot saved. Murray follows up the rebound. set to counter with a 4411 setup. Murray sets up for Yates to finish on 84 mins.

### Game 31: Ilkeston

Concede a poor goal on 13 mins. Not feeling confident at all about this match for some reason. lack of a left winger is a problem karl jones out there is best option. penalty to them on 65 mins. We get one back from the kickoff. Yates again. Yates scores an offside goal. bad loss.

### Game 32: Stafford

I've changed full backs. Britton is actually half decent at left back. Not much happening with the rain pouring down... 2nd half H. Turner crosses beautifully from deep for Yates to head home. 58 mins - henderson clips a cross into the box and Yates volleys into the top corner from the 18 yard box. 88 mins - henderson feeds a through ball for yates to run on to and get his hattrick.

### game 33: Hinckley

Of course Millar is away. Again.

narrow, counter.

3 mins: Yates goes on a bullish run, dragging about 5 opponents out of position. He rolls the ball back to Grieves who sets up Henderson for a crisp finish. 21 mins: Yates again charges down the left and crosses from the byline to the back post and Wright nods it in. and so the game ends

### FA trophy against Cambridge:

I've decide to throw the game and concentrate on the league. I'm sending out the youth and reserves. They duly oblige with a loss, conceding on 2 mins. Hardy at right back fucks up. On 18 mins we concede from a penalty. Thankfully there's no red for hoyle. 2-0 down. I set out to attack for 2nd half. I had purposefully left first teamers out of squad as I knew that mid game I would want to throw them on to avoid a spanking. It ends 2-0 which isn't as bad as the 6-0 I was worried about.

### game 34: AFC Telford

Was going to go for counter, but we're at home, so the usual attacking approach has been taken. Pays off on 31 mins when Jones sets up Yates. Henderson distracted the cb's and yates ghosted into the box. On 48 mins, an awful defending from lb results in a scrambled goal for them. Then Shaw finishes sweetly and we're 2-1 down at home

small tactical switches.. But I've got no game changers... (and no left winger)

57 Grieve to Yates to score straight from a corner. 18 yards out.

65 yates runs, henderson scores.

### game 35: Northwich.

personal theory: it's the games against the small teams which really matter. Bowden crosses -> henderson through ball -> yates hammers it home. good save from Earl Second half, grieve puts dunlop through. 2-0 it finishes. Very much in control.

### game 36: Alfreton

1st vs 2nd. away. best first 11. don't lose -> counter half chance for yates is blocked Fallows scores for them after finding space in the box. overload.. I still can't defend. dunlop can't finish from a free header 4-2-4: getting hammered 4-3-3: concede another and another from a break away. crap.

the lesson we learn? don't chop and change these players

### game 37: Gloucester

Millar (remember him?) finally returns defensive -> disappointed team ramm -> underrated send them out on overload we hammer them for 13 mins until yates scores. 53 mins millar injured 57 yates scores again Lee Joyce injured 82: get one back 87: Grieve forces an og direct from a freekick 91: long right wing break, cross and they score another. fun game 66 yates gets a hattrick

### game 38: Hyde

home 27 mins: Henderson goes down injured outside our box. Turner keeps on playing, driving down the right. Crossing low to Yates who's shot is blocked but Grieve finishes the rebound 29 mins: Bowden with a through ball to yates to smash home.

60 mins 3 subs 61 mins concede a goal. Soft shot slips through Earl's fingers 79 mins concede an equaliser... striaght down the middle. cbs gone to sleep. overload etc. 83 mins. Yates comes to the rescue again 86 mins. Yates sets up Grieve to run onto the ball and rifle home from 18 yards.

### game 39:Droylsden

away cagey.. Grieve at right back. shuffle players, yates on. game mood changes. 0-0 it ends...

### game 40: Harrogate

6mins: Henderson holds up the ball, rolls his man and puts Yates through on goal. 47 mins: direct free kick for them. One all. 63 mins: Harper loses the ball by the half way line and it breaks to Matthews who runs at the defence and chips Earl.

gutted

still first on goals scored.

### game 41: Fleetwood

Keeping an eye on Ilkeston v Alfreton . Alfreton 1 nil down. Yates scores on 12 mins from 20 yards. 16 mins: Yates scores again, dummying one defender and hammering past the keeper from 18 yards. 36 mins: Millar crosses for Wright to finish.

Alfreton now 2 nil down

3 points ahead. six goals better goal difference. game

### 42: Gainsborugh

draw, or don't lose by 6 goals and we're champions.

15 mins: Millar passes short to Lord in the box and he finishes at the far post... offside. 21: They then score. boweden loses the right winger, crosses into the box and in off the post. 29: Ball over the top and their striker runs onto it to score. counter... 78: Score again We win the league - alfreton only draw. crawling over the line.

Harry Turner has duplicated Steve Murrays trick of stat bump across all stats while still remaining not good enough. If there's one or two more of those he'll make a good player.

My most expensive player, Stevie Millar went out on international duty, came back and got injured straight away. He may be the best player in the league but I wouldn't know, I haven't seen him play.

Yates may not score a lot, but he makes things happen. With massive determination and good physical stats, he really unnerves defenses. With Henderson or a scoring midfielder behind him is when he works best.

It was a season of finding our feet, getting to know each other and then hitting stride at the right time. The Corby defeat brought us down, FA trophy wins lifted us again. Assuming promotion the following is planned:

\-need to recruit a center back & a free kick specialist. -need to consider dropping one central midfielder Ben Lyons or Steve Murray? -look around for a promising left back and a reserve right back (Jon Turner isn't good enough) Of course the one player I actually paid for isn't good enough.

\-must secure Mike Lord on loan for the full season next year. & Richardson or equivalent again. -look around for replacement for Coar & new g.k. coach (Earl isn't improving) -as always, scouring for free/cheap youngsters or indeed, any good players. -One year contracts as standard

\-need to organise prestiege friendlies. Losing a lot of money. -Finances -> we're eating into the large cash balance we had from the start of the season. -need trim fringe senior players (mcmanus etc...)

\-Planned rotation of players for the next 10 games. Squeaky bum time- > fitness counts.

And... [we're top.](http://spurious-logic.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/league_table_q3_2009.jpg)

Again, apologies for this being so incorherent but I can't face tidying it all up... Maybe I'll pick away at it. Maybe not
