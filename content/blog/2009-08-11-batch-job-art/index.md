Everyone who's had to work on medium length (too short to get anything meaningful done, too long to just stare in to a nonresponsive screen for) batch jobs or compilations has them. Little doodles at the side of notepads. Ever increasing in levels of complexity until they reach some sort of Escher graph across multiple pages.

It still doesn't count towards an art portfolio though.
