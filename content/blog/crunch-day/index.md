There's always one.

If you're in a good team it's a regular release day (Thursday being ideal) where everything you've worked on has been tested on your side and is going out to the client for further testing.

If you're in a bad team, it's that day at the end of your schedule when everything is done and you're unleashing your product on the client and are getting ready to wash your hands of it.

Guess which approach works in the long run. The first keeps your client in the loop, keeps the developers relaxed as any problems on this release can be solved in the next and prevents minor misunderstandings from escalating due to lack of communication.

The second allows the developers freedom to work without worrying about packaging releases, but they should be worrying that what they're producing isn't what the client wants.

Thursday is the ideal release day as

1- It allows development to continue Monday, Tuesday and most of Wednesday.

2-Test runs should be running for half of Wednesday and an actual release early Thursday.

3- if there's any issues, there's late Thursday and Friday to deal with them. IfÂ  there are no issues then development continues as normal.

If it were Monday all of the work would have been done the previous week and developers would be working from 2 day old memory if there were any problems.

Tuesday and Wednesday would mean that the earlier days would be disrupted as there's limited time to get work done.

Friday, is the last day of the week and the temptation would be there to rush an unready release out.
