Well, it's not quite 80 hour work weeks but a project is getting near code complete for the first release so between that additional pressure and parenting time at home and trying to buy a house there's been no time for posts.

Hopefully I will be back posting weekly by the end of the month, but probably not before that.

Yes, it is yet another why I'm not posting post.
