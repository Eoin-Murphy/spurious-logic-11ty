![provercelli](images/provercelli.png)If you have the 8 hours or so to follow a frankly fantastic blog detailing the fictional exploits of a real football team in Football Manager 2009.

TESTING

[www.runofplay.com](http://www.runofplay.com/category/vercelli/page/1/)

Excellent writing, funny and I found myself rooting for a team in a simulation of the 2019 champions league final, complete with player subplots and rivalries.

Technically the blog is brilliant as well with a great layout, typography and gameplay videos. The soundtracks alone are worth checking out.

I'm now considering starting up a game as some bottom league team and fictionalising their progress over the years.
