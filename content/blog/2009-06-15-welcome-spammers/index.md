So I got my first comments and of course they're spammers so I've installed bad behaviour and hopefully that'll keep the riff raff out for a while...

The weather was gorgeous here over the weekend and sunday morning I went surfing. First time in Ireland and with a wetsuit it was very comfortable temperature and constant waves off a beach break (so I'm told, it's not like I know this stuff.)

I did learn that I'm a long way from fit but it was lots of fun. Board rental was €10 an hour for a softboard and €15 for a hard board (an extra €8 for a wetsuit, or €35 total if you wanted to join a class).

These are the people down there ([http://surfgtown.com/](http://surfgtown.com/)).
