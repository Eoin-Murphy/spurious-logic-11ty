I'm doing through a simple MVC project at the moment and I wasted 45 mins trying to get Nuget to install Ninject on a newly created class library.

No matter what I was doing, it just wouldn't work. It was creating the reference. I could see the reference in the Resources list but it wasn't in the usual packages folder. It was hidden in some weird folder under "User/eoin/Documents".

I can't believe it too me so long to realise that I'd created a Web Class Library (Package) and not a standard Class Library.

45 mins.

I then went to bed and dreamt of using statements with red underlines.
