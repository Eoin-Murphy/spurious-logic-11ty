Seriously.

I find it difficult to express just what a change it is. Suddenly it feels like a totally different computer.

I do most of my work on a VM and previously there were 30 second plus wait times to do anything of any signifigance, but now it's like working directly on the host system. A fast host.

Absolutely crazy. I'm never going back if I can possibly help it.
