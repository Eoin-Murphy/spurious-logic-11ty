So I played a bit more Red Faction and I've got a couple of thoughts.

First of all, (as I mentioned before) I played this like 6~7 years ago on PS2 and I keep on getting these semi-flashbacks. I go through huge sections without recognising anything but then there'll be an enemy or a particular environment which triggers a vague hint of recognition. Who knows, maybe I actually finished this before?

Anyway, the red/brown gave way to industrial grey and then back to red/brown. I'm getting messages from some random hacker/resistance leader on where to go. Which I'm completely ignoring. Which is fine as it's usually blindingly obvious where you're meant to go anyway. - Except that one time when I was told "the trains were disabled" and then to progress the story I had to walk into one of the disabled trains and wait for a trap to spring. Impeccable logic there unless I missed something obvious. I know you're proud of your set pieces but come on...

Every now and then I'm meeting big enemies which are meant to be a significant obstacle but with a mouse and keyboard I'm either blowing them away quickly (I'm not bragging as I'm really not that great a FPS player - just the difficulty level is way off) or just going around them.

The big selling point of the game was destructible environment, which is great the 2~3 times I could be arsed using it. I don't want to talk about graphics as it is an older game and so wouldn't be fair.

I finally got the assault rifle which seems to be the "super weapon" for this game. i.e. fast rate of fire, good damage, good accuracy, plentiful ammo. The sniper rifle is awkward and the shotgun has too slow a rate of fire.

Anyway, I'm only 40 mins into it so far so maybe I'll be proven wrong on all of these later on. It's not bad, just a very standard rail shooter so far.
