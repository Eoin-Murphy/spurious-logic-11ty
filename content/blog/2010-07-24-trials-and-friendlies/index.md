I waded through so many players which were really really not up to scratch. Either old and over the hill with critical physical attributes in steep decline "Pace 2, really you expect to be paid to play?" or young kids who don't have what it'll take to make it "As a striker with worse finishing than my worst defender, no long range shooting ability and the positional sense of a penguin in the Arctic, don't you want to reconsider leaving school at 16?"

DL: **Augusto Guerrero**. Fast and aggressive. Not so great defending. I'm hoping to use him as a marauding wing back. This means that my right back (**Daniel Leon)**will be concentrating more on defensive duties.

DM\\MC:  **Migul Ángel Ortega**. Physically tough with decent technique and determination. He's probably not going to score a lot but if he can add a bit of bite to the middle of the park it should help us from being overrun as I think our previous midfielders were too lightweight.

FC: **Fernando**. Fast and can finish. I have a lot of hope for this guy. Composure and off the ball aren't great but his pace and finishing are an excellent combination. I can see him working as either our primary striker in a 4-5-1, chasing after long balls and taking passes to feet or instead as a poacher next to a taller target man, picking up on secondary balls.

These should all be starters. The only thing I didn't get was a decent centre back. So to that end we're getting a parent club, Levante.

As far as I can tell the only benefit of having a parent club so far is that they tell you "No you can't have our 'B' squad players on loan" much more quickly than the other teams. So thanks a lot for nothing. I hope we're getting paid for the privilege of not loaning your players.
