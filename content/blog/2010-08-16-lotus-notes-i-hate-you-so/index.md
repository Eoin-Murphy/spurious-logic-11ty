Lotus Notes I hate you so, neither client nor server always crashing, collecting data can you just deliver email?

Between that and the bloody startup splash screen it's such a turd of an app.

Add in my pc's 10 minute delay after login (I think it's retrieving the user settings from a remote server) and 5 minute spazz-out as antivirus rescans everything and I'm lucky if I can actually get working until 20 minutes after I'm in the office.

This is why I just set my PC to standby most week days. (which has had the weird effect of deleted items becoming un-deleted at random times... THANKS WINDOWS!)
