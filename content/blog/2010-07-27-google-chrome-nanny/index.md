![nanny](/assets/img/nanny.jpg "nanny")I'll be the first to admit that I don't have the strongest willpower so the Google Crome Nanny extension is a godsend for my productivity. The fact that whole swathes of time consuming web content isn't available to me for specified times of the day means that I don't even waste the time fighting not to browse.

I have a list of sites blocked at specified times (09:00 - 12:30, 14:00 to 16:00) which are fairly flexible. I add to that list as I find timesink sites. Yes this one is on that list.

Even if you do have very strong willpower, the best step is to remove the temptation. Where I've really noticed it is [during compile/batch run time](http://xkcd.com/303). That 30secs ~ 2mins where I literally have nothing to do and I think "I'll just see what's in Google reader". 20mins later and I've completely lost my train of thought with the work that I was doing.

As an aside, that you don't have to restart Chrome to install plugins is fantastic. I don't get any annoying notifications that "3 of 10 extenstions have been upgraded" or "you are now running google chrome 1.0.1.18.B". I don't care about that stuff. I want a seamless experience and I trust my opensource browser to take care of itself without the handholding.

<edit>Actually the cutoff starts 13:30 to 16:00. Completed editing in Internet Explorer. Yest I know I can circumvent all of this by using a different browser but have you actually browsed the web with IE and no adblock. It's not particularly fun and doesn't last long.
