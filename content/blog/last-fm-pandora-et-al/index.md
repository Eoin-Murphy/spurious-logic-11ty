I recently signed up for Last.fm and overall I'm very happy with it. I had used Pandora.com in the past (when it was possible to listen to it from outside the US and they both seem to suffer from the same problem.

I have a fairly wide range of musical tastes and while I might want to listen to ambient/classical pieces in the morning with something more alt rock/post-rock in the afternoon the radio setting is pretty much one speed. i.e. If you pick "Sigur RÃ³s" radio you're not getting anything except abstract iclandic noodlings until you change the station.

It'd be nice if there was a -> make more rocky/make more mellow type setting. Maybe something like, start with "Queens of the Stone Age", and go to "Beethoven" by way of "The Mountain Goats" over a period of 4 hours.

It'd make for an interesting listening experience if nothing else.

\>>edit 18-01-2011 >> discontinued last.fm as I found it had hit some kind of limit on the pool of tracks it was playing me and seemed to be just repeating the same ones over and over
